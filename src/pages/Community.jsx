            normal community shell below — it doesn't just skip re-rendering
            CommunityStyle, it never mounts it at all. PrivateChatWindow reuses
            ChatMessage/ChatComposer verbatim (message bubbles, composer pill,
            reply bar, image preview strip, attach button, date separators,
            the action-menu backdrop, error text) and every one of those
            classNames is only defined inside CommunityStyle.jsx — PrivateChatStyle
            deliberately doesn't redefine them (see its header comment). With
            only <PrivateChatStyle /> mounted here, all of that came out as
            unstyled browser-default markup: a plain rectangular textarea and
            send button, borderless message bubbles, an invisible reply bar —
            which is exactly what "private chat UI is not working" looks like
            even though every click handler underneath was firing correctly.
            Mounting CommunityStyle alongside PrivateChatStyle here (both are
            plain <style> tags, safe to have both mounted at once) restores
            every shared class this page depends on. */}
