  {
    q: "Is StudyBun actually free?",
    a: "Yep — 100% free, no ads, no premium tier hiding behind a paywall. Just a little study buddy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do I need to sign in at all?",
    a: "So your streaks, sessions and badges live somewhere safe and sync across every device you open StudyBun on — instead of living only in one browser tab that could get wiped.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where does my data actually go?",
    a: "It's saved in a private database (Supabase) under your account only. Nothing here is public, sold, or handed to advertisers — this app doesn't even have any.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when I use the AI features?",
    a: "AI Insights and the Study Buddy chat send the relevant bits of your study data to Google's Gemini API to write your tips — and only when you actually open those features, never in the background.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get my data out, or delete it?",
    a: "Settings → Export gives you a full JSON backup anytime, no asking needed. Want your account wiped instead? Reach out to me (see the last question below) and I'll delete it by hand.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who's actually behind this?",
    a: "Just one JEE dropper building the study tool he wished existed. Bugs, ideas and gentle roasting are all welcome 🐰",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I actually reach you?",
    custom: "scratch",
    a: "Scratch the little card below to reveal it — kept it hidden from bots that scrape pages for emails to spam.",
