 * "Studying Now" card for the Focus Timer page. `studyingIds` is the same
 * ephemeral Realtime Presence set already shared with Leaderboard/Community
 * (see useStudyPresence) -- a bare Set of user ids, no names. Presence
 * intentionally never broadcasts a name/mascot itself (that would mean every
 * client trusting whatever the *other* client claims about itself), so
 * names are resolved the same trusted way the rest of Community does: a
 * batched get_community_profiles RPC call, cached client-side per user id
 * so re-renders (the set changes constantly as people start/stop) don't
 * re-fetch anyone already resolved.
